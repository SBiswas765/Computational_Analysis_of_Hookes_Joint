# 🔩 Computational_Analysis_of_Hookes_Joint

A Python tool to **analyze and visualize the kinematics** of a Hooke's (universal) joint. It calculates critical parameters like shaft speeds, angular acceleration, and angles (θ₁–θ₄), then generates both a **polar velocity diagram** and a **real-time simulation** of the joint's motion.

Ideal for:
- 🛠 Mechanical design validation  
- 🎓 Educational demonstrations  
- 📊 Kinematic analysis projects

## 📌 Features

- 🧮 **Analytical Calculation**  
  Computes:
  - Input/output shaft speeds (RPM)
  - Output shaft angular acceleration (rad/s²)
  - Characteristic angles: θ₁, θ₂, θ₃, θ₄

- 📈 **Polar Velocity Diagram**  
  - Visualizes velocity variation of the driven shaft
  - Shows max/min RPM in polar format

- 🎞 **Animated Simulation**  
  - Real-time animation of input and output shaft motion
  - Visual demonstration of angular misalignment effects

- 🖥 **Interactive CLI**  
  - User input for driving shaft speed (N) and shaft angle (α)
